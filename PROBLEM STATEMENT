### **Title:** *Hospital Appointment Management System on Salesforce*

### **Problem Statement:**

Hospitals often face challenges in managing patient appointments, doctor availability, and scheduling conflicts using manual methods or disconnected systems. These manual processes lead to appointment overlaps, missed confirmations, poor communication with patients, and inefficient use of doctor time.

There is a need for a centralized, automated system that can efficiently handle **doctor scheduling, patient appointments, confirmations, notifications, and reports** ‚Äî all within a secure and scalable platform like Salesforce.

3. To enhance doctor‚Äìpatient coordination by maintaining accurate and real-time availability data.
4. To provide management with **insightful reports and dashboards** for better decision-making.
5. To ensure secure data handling using Salesforce‚Äôs **profiles, permissions, and validation rules**.

### **Expected Outcome:**

By implementing this system in Salesforce, hospitals can:

* Reduce manual effort in managing appointments.
